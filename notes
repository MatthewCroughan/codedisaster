medfile in nixpkgs produces libmedC.so but not libmed.so, it's probably supposed
to be symlinked such that `postFixup = "ln -s $out/lib/libmedC.so $out/lib/libmed.so";`


When SCOTCH_Num is undefined, it's because we haven't passed
"-DINSTALL_METIS_HEADERS=OFF" to the cmakeFlags, which causes metis.h to be
produced which shadows the correct metis.h

When an error like this is thrown, it means that scotch wasn't compiled with -DINTSIZE64:

When _mfacre is missing like this, it means that medfile was compiled without a
fortran compiler present in the build process:

When you get an undefined reference to symbol 'MEDlibrarynumVersion', it's
because -lmed was passed instead of -lmedC, one way to fix that is
LDFLAGS="-lmedC", but this is imperfect and needs a better solution:

When this petscsysdef.mod is missing it means that petscsysdef.mod was not found
on the include path, solution is to set something like NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE = "-I${mumps}/include -I${petsc}/include -I${petsc}/lib/petsc4py -I${petsc}/lib/petsc4py/include";
